        <h3 class="fade-in">About Me</h3>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p class="fade-in delay-1">
                I've walked the path of entrepreneurship and leadership myself—as a founder, CEO, and leader navigating high-growth environments. Along the way, I've worked with incredible coaches who profoundly shaped my journey. I know the terrain because I've been in it.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in delay-2">
                What sets my approach apart is the integration of this firsthand experience with over 20 years of dedicated meditation practice and personal growth. I've trained with some of the best executive coaches in Silicon Valley, bringing depth to my work with clients.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in delay-3">
                When I'm not coaching, building, or meditating, I spend my time with my wife and our two young children.
            </p>

    <!-- Approach Section -->
    <section id="approach" class="approach">
        <h3 class="fade-in">My Approach</h3>
        <div class="approach-content">
            <p class="fade-in delay-1">
                I don't subscribe to formulaic tools or surface-level techniques like "how to give feedback." Instead, I focus on the deeper truths: who you are and how you show up. Authenticity isn't just a concept; it's the foundation. If it's not real, people feel it. And real leadership starts from within.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in delay-2">
                My coaching comes from an awake space filled with love and compassion. I trust in your body's wisdom and hold a safe space that allows for the natural unfolding of clearing stored emotions and limiting beliefs. With sharp but gentle nudges, I guide you at your own pace towards loving resolution.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in delay-3">
                In practice, I combine techniques from state-of-the-art Western modalities like Internal Family Systems (IFS) with Eastern insights, especially from the Buddhist path. It's not about a technique; it's a state—a way of being that comes from having walked the path yourself.

                If you're looking for advice or someone to tell you what to do, there are experts for that (and that's not me). But if you want to remove the blocks that let your own wisdom and clarity flow—and along the way experience more joy, ease, and peace—then I might be your guy.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in delay-2">
                I work with leaders ready to explore and expand their emotional fluidity, decision-making, communication, and authentic power. Together, we'll uncover the blocks and unleash your potential to lead with clarity, connection, and confidence.
